# mini-utils
This is a set of small commands I am making to learn x64 assembly for Linux.

## Build
The only packages you need are: `make`, `nasm`, and `ld`.
Run `make debug` to generate a debuggable binary.

I don't have a Makefile set up in the root directory of this project, so you will have to run make in each subfolder.
