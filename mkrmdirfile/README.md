# mkrmdirfile
Create and remove files and directories

## Usage
touch: Creates files, doesn't care if the file already exists.

rm: Removes files, but cannot remove folders or act recursively.
Make your own shell script to do that.

rmdir: Removes empty directories.

mkdir: Creates directories.

## Errors
No error messages are returned to the console.
If you want to check the error message, use the `echo $?` command after to check for errors.
